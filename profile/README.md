# Welcome 👋
A consistent integration Framework approach built using Apache Camel. This framework we refer to as the Integration Framework for HDF (Healthcare Data Foundation) is intended to be a tier of reusable and extensible capabilities. As such, it is all about enabling a consistent design pattern/accelerator based mindset to help healthcare organizations innovate in a new and comprehensive manner. Our focus has been, and will continue to be, how we simplify data access within healthcare and focus on ensuring data is the asset.

Here are a few key things to know as you read this:

All the Integration Framework for HDF assets, like all assets within Project-Herophilus, are available and provided "as-is" under the Apache 2 license model.
The basis of all the efforts for Intelligent DaaS is that Data is the Asset and this set of repositories are intended to help anyone connect and build innovative platforms for usage with a variety of data: healthcare and beyond. Everything we provide is provided under Apache-2 Open Source licenses AS IS. THEY ARE NOT PRODUCTS AND WILL NOT BECOME A PRODUCTS. We work very hard to ensure they continue to drive enabling capabilities in a consitent manner, as a design pattern/accelerator. This specific repository is focused around providing comprehensive healthcare connectivity and routing of data.
Integration Framework for HDF is all about enabling connectivity to data. For ease of use and scale we have isolated each specific type of connectivity into its own specific solution. This repository is all about showcasing capabilities through software and is a value add.
This platform has everything of other integration platforms such as management interfaces. There is also the capability to quickly and easily customize where you want logs to end up with numerous industry-leading technologies such as Data Dog, Splunk, etc. In addition, the platform enables implementations to also build highly customized visualizd dashboards as well simply with Grafana.
